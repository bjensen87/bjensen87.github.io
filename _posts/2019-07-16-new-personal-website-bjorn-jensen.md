Hi Everybody, I'm Bjorn. I'd been looking for a fast and easy way to store my scribbles and abouts on the internet.
GitHub proved to be the best solution with its [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) library. It actually is a lot easier than I 
thought it was going to be. Stay tuned for more posts as I get the hang of it!
